# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Fringe Matrix Gallery is a full-stack React + Express application for fan-created avatar images. It uses Vercel Blob for CDN image storage and organizes images by campaigns (TV episodes).

## Commands

### Development
```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies (requires Node 22+)
npm run dev          # Start client (port 5173) + server (port 3000) concurrently
npm run dev:server   # Server only (TypeScript via tsx)
npm run dev:client   # Client dev server only
```

### Build
```bash
npm run build        # Full production build (generates build-info + client build)
npm start            # Start production server
```

### Testing
```bash
npm test                     # Run all tests (server + client)
npm run test:server          # Server tests (Jest + ts-jest)
npm run test:server:watch    # Server tests in watch mode
npm run test:client          # Client tests (Vitest)
npm run test:e2e             # E2E tests (Playwright, 2 workers)
npm run test:e2e:headed      # E2E with visible browser
npm run test:e2e:conservative # E2E with 1 worker (rate-limit safe)
```

Run a single test file:
```bash
npx playwright test app.spec.ts           # Single e2e test file
npx playwright test -g "Build Info"       # By test name
npm run test:server -- --testPathPattern=api.test.ts  # Single server test
```

### Type Checking
```bash
npm run typecheck    # TypeScript check (client only)
```

## Architecture

```
client/               # React + TypeScript frontend (Vite)
  src/
    App.tsx          # Main component with full app state
    hooks/           # Custom hooks (useLightboxAnimations)
    utils/           # Utility functions
    types/api.ts     # API contract types
  test/              # Vitest unit tests

server/               # Express + TypeScript backend
  server.ts          # Main entry point (~700 lines, handles all routes)
  test/              # Jest/Supertest API tests

e2e/                  # Playwright tests
  playwright.config.ts  # Main config

data/
  campaigns.yaml     # Campaign definitions (hashtag, dates, links)
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/campaigns` - List all campaigns
- `GET /api/campaigns/:id/images` - Images for a campaign (from Vercel Blob)
- `GET /api/build-info` - Deployment metadata
- `GET /avatars/*` - Redirects to Vercel Blob CDN

## Key Implementation Details

**Client-Server Flow:**
1. Client fetches `/api/campaigns` on mount
2. Selects campaign from URL hash or first available
3. Fetches `/api/campaigns/{id}/images`
4. Preloads all images in parallel, then renders

**Vercel Blob Integration:**
- Server caches blob listings (30s TTL) to reduce API calls
- Implements retry with exponential backoff for rate limits
- Falls back to empty lists if `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is missing

**Environment Variables:**
- `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` - Required for production, optional for development
- `VITE_LOADING_SCREEN` - Loading screen selection: 'legacy', 'terminal' (default), or 'glyphs'

**Loading Screens:**
- Three loading screen options available via `VITE_LOADING_SCREEN` environment variable
- `legacy` - Simple "Fringe Matrix 5 Loading..." message (original style)
- `terminal` - Terminal-style boot sequence with typing animation (default, current)
- `glyphs` - Fringe glyphs rotating on black background (minimalist)
- Configuration in `client/src/config/loadingScreen.ts`
- Individual components in `client/src/components/` (LegacyLoadingScreen, TerminalLoadingScreen, GlyphsLoadingScreen)

**Build Info:**
- Generated by `scripts/generate-build-info.js`
- `commitHash: "dev-local"` in development
- Actual git hash in CI/production

# Understanding console error for asynchronous response

Very rarely I do get this error in console. Doesn't break the site but still would like to see what could be the reason.
```
Uncaught (in promise) Error: A listener indicated an asynchronous response by returning true, but the message channel closed before a response was received
``` Insight from Chrome is attached.

I’m going to quickly scan the codebase to see if it uses browser extension messaging or `postMessage`, which could cause that specific console error. Running a few searches in parallel for relevant keywords.

### Likely cause
That message is almost always emitted by a Chrome/Brave extension, not by your app. It happens when an extension content-script sends a message to its background/service worker, marks it as “async” (returns true), but the page or the extension context goes away before the response is delivered.

Because it’s rare/intermittent and your site keeps working, this strongly suggests a third‑party extension racing with SPA navigations, tab switches, or rapid unmounts.

### How to confirm
- Open the console, click the source link on the error. If it opens a `chrome-extension://<id>/...` URL, it’s an extension.
- Try Incognito/Guest profile with all extensions disabled; the error should disappear.
- Re‑enable extensions one by one to find the offender, or check `chrome://extensions` → “Errors” for any extension showing this message.

### If it turns out to be your code (only relevant if you’re building an extension or using runtime messaging)
- Only `return true` from `chrome.runtime.onMessage` when you will definitely call `sendResponse`.
- Ensure `sendResponse` is called on all code paths, including error paths and timeouts.
- Cancel pending async work on `beforeunload`/route change, or call `port.disconnect()`/`sendResponse` before the page unloads.
- Prefer a `Port` (persistent connection) via `chrome.runtime.connect` and handle `port.onDisconnect` to avoid dangling responses.
- Add a timeout guard:
  - If a response isn’t sent within N ms, send an error response instead of letting the channel close silently.

Example guard pattern:
```javascript
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) => {
  let done = false;
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    if (!done) { done = true; sendResponse({ error: 'timeout' }); }
  }, 5000);

  someAsyncTask().then(result => {
    if (!done) { done = true; clearTimeout(timer); sendResponse({ result }); }
  }).catch(err => {
    if (!done) { done = true; clearTimeout(timer); sendResponse({ error: String(err) }); }
  });

  return true; // indicates async response
});
```

### Practical next steps
- Run your app in a clean browser profile to verify it’s extension-related.
- If you identify the extension, consider filing a bug with its author; there’s nothing needed in your app unless you’re the one using extension APIs.

Status update: I scanned the repo for extension/messaging APIs (`chrome.runtime`, `postMessage`, `MessageChannel`, `serviceWorker`, `message` listeners) and found none, which supports the conclusion that this comes from a third-party extension injected into your page.

- It’s almost certainly from a browser extension’s messaging.
- Confirm by following the source link and testing with extensions disabled.
- No action needed in your code unless you’re writing an extension; if so, ensure every async `onMessage` path calls `sendResponse` or avoids `return true` unnecessarily.

```javascript
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) => {
  let done = false;
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    if (!done) { done = true; sendResponse({ error: 'timeout' }); }
  }, 5000);

  someAsyncTask().then(result => {
    if (!done) { done = true; clearTimeout(timer); sendResponse({ result }); }
  }).catch(err => {
    if (!done) { done = true; clearTimeout(timer); sendResponse({ error: String(err) }); }
  });

  return true; // indicates async response
});
```

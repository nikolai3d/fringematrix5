<h2>History of Fringe Matrix</h2>

<p>Fringe Matrix aims to preserve the art that was created for the Fringe Twitter campaigns, from January 2012 to January 2013, from the middle of Season 4 to the series finale, with last episode of Season 5 airing in on January 18th, 2013.</p>

<h3>The Beginning</h3>

<p>When the ratings started to fall at the beginning of Season 4, some of the fans started trying to figure out what more we could do to help. Notably, 
Annie Burnaman (@birdandbear), Aimee (@aimeeinchains), Emma (@dalliel) and Kelly (@fringeship) came up with the idea of Twitter campaigns to help promote the show and unite the fans.
With technical support from Nikolai (@nikolai3d), they created the first Twitter campaign, #CrossTheLine, on January 13th, 2012. The idea was for the fans of the show to start using a designated hashtag to show their support for the show, all at the same time so other people could see it and join in, and maybe even get it trending on Twitter.

You can read more about the beginning of the campaigns in this article from February 2012: <a href="http://www.fringetelevision.com/2012/02/introducing-fringenuity-how-we-can-help.html">http://www.fringetelevision.com/2012/02/introducing-fringenuity-how-we-can-help.html</a>

<h3>So, What's The Art For?</h3>

<p>To promote and spread avareness of the campaigns each week, a subgroup of fans skilled in digital art would create avatars for the campaigns, and encourage everyone to use them as a profile picture.
   Nikolai (@nikolai3d) created a website (now defunct) to display the avatars for the campaigns, and allow people to quickly set their profile picture to any of the avatars for the campaign.

<h3>Preserving the Art</h3>

<p>Though a lot of original websites are now sadly defunct, the art remained, organized on my hard drive, so I have decided to make a new website to display the art, sorted by campaigns and celebrating the creativity and hard work of the fans who created them. I hope you enjoy this little slice of TV Fandom history.
